# SnakeAI
An incredibly fun to watch implementation of machine learning to Snake

#How it works

Run SnakeAI.py and watch the magic happen. If you want to train the AI yourself youre entirely welcome to. Just know that it took at least 15 hours to train.
That included multiprocessing of 8 at a time.

#Dependencies

You can have a read of the actual python files, but mainly stablebaselines3, gym and mumpy.
